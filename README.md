np-tools
=====================================
Repository for personal tools. Mostly openFrameworks based, they will require some addition addon to compile.

- `tilecutter` : for importing tiles sketched by hand to transparent .png files
- `framescan` : i use this for importing little doodles or graphical elements to be used frame by frame, look at a demo [here](http://npisanti.com/journal/2019_07_28__framescan.html)
- `folderkit` : headless sample player to use with ORCA
- `wolframkit` : wolfram automata rhytmic playground

The code in this repository will change as the water flows, don't be attached to it =)
