np-tools
=====================================
Repository for personal tools. Mostly openFrameworks based, they will require some additional addon to compile.    
    
- `camwaves` : generates .xml waveforms from webcam 
- `tilecutter` : for importing tiles sketched by hand to transparent .png files
- `framescan` : i use this for importing little doodles or graphical elements to be used frame by frame, look at a demo [here](http://npisanti.com/practice/framescan.html)
- `pixelscript` : 2d graphics scripting playground 
- `rpiezos` : raspberry pi piezo sensor shield to OSC 
- `substrata` : headless samplers/synths playground to use with ORCA
    
All is very work in progress.
